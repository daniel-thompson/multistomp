This example implements a USB MIDI device to demonstrate the use of the
USB device stack. It implements the device configuration found in Appendix
B of the Universal Serial Bus Device Class Definition for MIDI Devices.

The button sends note on/note off messages.

The board will also react to identity request (or any other data sent to
the board) by transmitting an identity message in reply.

Board connections:
------------------

  PA4   (optional LED)	LED connected via a current limiting resistor to GND
  PA8	(button)	Switch, connected to GND, to enable loader
  PB8	(hotplug)	1.5k resister connected to P2 pin 1 (next to push
			switch). This connection is optional but avoids the
			need to continually plug/unplug the board before and
			after programming.
  USB	(mini USB)	USB acting as device, connect to computer
